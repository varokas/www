<li><a href="http://varokas.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/measuring-requirements-engineering-success.pdf">Measuring Requirements Engineering Success</a>. This is actually my term paper on one of the subject I study: Managing Software Development.

<h3>Wordy Introduction</h3>
<p>Hello World!</p>
<p>My name is Varokas, but I usually go by my given nickname 'Non'. I was born and raised in Thailand for almost all my life. I have been around computers since I was 13 years old -- a real first class geek you may say. I entered the world of software cranking workforce in 2007, facing the truth of inefficient commercial software development. Deeply believe that things could be much better, I began to get myself familiar with this dark art we called Software Engineering.</p>
<p>After confusingly self-taught myself for a while, I decided to go to Carnegie Mellon to get a full-time education in Software Engineering. I met a lot of interesting minds from around the world. We all shared the same slogan of being an 'agent of change' to the world of software crafting. After my grad school, I went back to work full time on Software. First in Ohio, then in Seattle, WA. I was doing Agile pretty much the whole time.</p>
<p>Here's my first step towards being agent of change. To share what I learned, experienced, accomplished, failed about SE so far and all that will come in the future. Because software development is fun, and we all deserve it!</p>
<h3>SE &amp; Me</h3>
<p>A few bullets point about what I did in software engineering (and what software engineering did to me).</p>
<ul>
<li>CMMi is not the root of all evil, it's how people use them.</li>
<li>Although I usually screams Agile!, I am a strong supporter of The Introductory Team Software Process (<a href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/tsp/tools/tspi/" target="_blank">TSPi</a>) as a tool for software engineering education for College students.</li>
<li>Agile Practices I adore: Test Driven Development, Continuous Integration User Story, Planning Poker, Backlog, Burndown Chart, Embrace Changes</li>
<li>SE Practices I adore: Peer Review, Effective Meeting, Condition-Consequences Risk Management, Misuse cases, Architectural Design, Goal-Questions-Metrics.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Misc. Stuff</h3>
<ul>
<li>I'm passionate about piano playing by ear. Cannot read a single note.</li>
</ul>
