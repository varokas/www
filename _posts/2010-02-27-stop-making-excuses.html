<p>I would like to make my first post with an open letter to software industry.</p>
<p>Dear Software Industry,</p>
<p>I would like to ask for your precious productive time to watch these video with me. This is a documentary about a design firm, <a title="IDEO" href="http://www.ideo.com/" target="_blank">IDEO</a>, who were challenged to reinvent a shopping cart in 5 days. The video is split in 3 parts. For each one, I will mark point of interests for you.</p>
<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUazVjvsMHs]</p>
<ul>
<li>[2:55] Today we are going to talk about the process of product design.</li>
<li>[3:43] The team kick off the project with a project charter</li>
<li>[5:07] "We are expert on the process of design". "Innovate by applying our <em>process</em> to it".</li>
</ul>
<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_civr9fr4iw]</p>
<ul>
<li>[0:30] I can see some form of requirements elicitation here, one that I could compare to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_design" target="_blank">Contextual design</a></li>
<li>[2:48] You can see a brainstorming process with some rules to govern how it is conducted</li>
<li>[4:30] Prioritization process follows to surface ideas that could be realized</li>
<li>[5:20] Define need areas split the team to create prototypes of each one. The project manager helps setting goals for the team.</li>
</ul>
<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zddv5Bv7da8]</p>
<ul>
<li>[1:45] Review and Demo session</li>
<li>[2:35] "Fail often in order to succeed sooner" == Release often and embrace change?</li>
<li>[6:00] Using the design process in order to innovate</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, Kelley mentioned in several occasions about how they are successful with the design process they have. Such things are not unique to IDEO or even to product design industry. I experienced similar mindset when I was trained by an advertisement agency during my internship. They explains their process to talk to customer to set a clear goal of an ad, work towards that goal, constantly review between ourselves and the client and make necessary adjustments.</p>
<p>Unlike you, software industry, these creative people do not view their process as an inhibitor of innovations, but a very key foundation to their success. They know that "innovation is real work that can and should be managed like any other corporate function. Success is more likely to result from the systematic pursuit of opportunities than from a flash of genius." [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12195923" target="_blank">ref</a>]. In other words, they do believe that effective teamwork is only possible with the right amount of process.</p>
<p>In conclusion. I would like to kindly ask you to please stop making excuses...</p>
<ul>
<li>That we are so fundamentally different from other discipline such that simple principles of healthy collaboration and teamworks do not apply</li>
<li>That software development are purely innovative business, therefore chaotic by nature and no kind of processes could help that. You can see that there are people out there, with their success and career based entirely on creative thinking, rely on these process for their workday to function smoothly.</li>
<li>That software are late because customers changed their mind every second and rework are inevitable. Could that be, perhaps, because you did not do a very good job to let them understand what they need better?</li>
</ul>
<p>Why don't you start your very next workday with a new look on software processes. They are not there just to make life difficult. With the right amount of it, that might be your next secret sauce of ensuring effective teamwork and a key to deliver quality products on time.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Me</p>
