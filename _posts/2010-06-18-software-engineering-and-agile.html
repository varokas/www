<h3>Agile Invasion</h3>
<p>One of the cool thing in being MSE/MSIT-SE graduates is that people suddenly start asking you a lot of questions regarding Software Engineering. It is unfortunate that I don't always posses an authoritative answer, but these great questions make me realize how people perceive SE and expand my horizon in general.</p>
<p>A friend asked: 'What about this Agile thing? How can we ensure quality of work doing Agile instead of Software Engineering?'. After I did my puzzled face for a couple of seconds, I realized his concerned is about increasing popular Agile practices taking over the traditional software development methodologies. He wondered about how could we ensure quality without having proper documents and thinking about every move up front. Explaining Agile manifesto and some of the practices to him, I came to realize an important fact that...</p>
<h3>A Shift of Energy</h3>
<p>"Agile is not to replace Traditional Software Engineering, it is another way to do Software Engineering" -- I replied</p>
<p>Think about it for a second. Look at all these Agile practices. It almost seems like Agile is proposing a total different way for software development. My argument is that the core values is still there, it's just that the underlying activity is different. Here's what I think: Agile is for born for coders: those people who love to write, craft and nurture codes rather than the grand plan and beautiful wall design. It is deliberately made such that the coders would enjoy doing SE practices by shifting their coding energy towards doing all these good practices. That is why it is gear towards executable artifacts rather than static documents that serve contractual and archiving purpose. For managerial aspects, Agile empowers the engineers to plan and estimate on a need-basis rather than view it from 10,000 ft strategic view.</p>
<p>Here are few examples that I can think of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Requirements: </strong>Specifications &gt;&gt; User Story</li>
<li><strong>Planning: </strong>All-Up-Front(tm) &gt;&gt; Iterative Planning</li>
<li><strong>Tracking: </strong>Earned Value &gt;&gt; Burndown Chart</li>
<li><strong>Estimation: </strong>Wideband Delphi &gt;&gt; Planning Poker</li>
<li><strong><strong>Design: </strong><span style="font-weight:normal;">Design Documents &gt;&gt; JavaDoc</span></strong></li>
<li><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> Manual Test Case &gt;&gt; Automated Unit / Integration Test  / Test Driven Development</li>
<li><strong>Integration: </strong>Build Instructions &gt;&gt; Build Script</li>
<li><strong>Deployment: </strong>Deploy Instructions &gt;&gt; Continuous Deployment</li>
</ul>
<p>To mock the Agile Manifesto: "While we value practices on the left, we think that the practices on the right deliver the same core value, but a whole lot more fun to do." -- Honest Coders</p>
<h3><strong>The Hidden Message</strong></h3>
<p>Imagine that you just get this young hotshot who just graduated and ready to code on all cylinders. Would he prefer "Write a deployment instruction" or "Write an automated deploy script"? What would you prefer?</p>
<p>Since the practices are geared toward, well, geeks. The key to success is to make sure that your team enjoy coding and implicitly loves to work with technologies. It is my wish that everybody coming in this business do share this same passion, but that is the assumption that has been proven wrong a few times before. Since the energy shift from papers and proof-reading into the more automated, more code-oriented, we need people who is passionate about these thing in the team to make it enjoyable.</p>
<p>As your team gets better at these Agile practices, they will soon forget that they are doing the boring SE stuff and should "... [reach] hyper-productivity by developing software as if playing a game" (of coding and collaborative meeting) [<a href="http://twitter.com/juacompe/status/14169907379">ref</a>].</p>
